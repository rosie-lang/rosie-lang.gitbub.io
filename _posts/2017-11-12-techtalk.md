I recently gave an IBM Tech Talk ([replay available here](
https://developer.ibm.com/code/videos/tech-talk-replay-rosie-pattern-language-faster-data-mining/))
on Rosie v1.0.  And there's a
[subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/RosiePatternLanguage/) available for discussion and questions.

The talk covers:

* How regex fails to scale "in the large", i.e. to complex patterns, large
collections of patterns, teams of developers, and big data.
* RPL extends the core concepts of regex, resulting in a pattern language
that is familiar to developers yet strictly more powerful than regular expressions.
* RPL is designed like a programming language, with attention to
readability, maintainability, modularity (packages), and to (devops) tools.

The last part of the last point is important.  Inspired in some ways by how the
designers of Google's Go paid attention to software engineering practice, Rosie
was designed to work well with software tools like Git, Travis, Jenkins, and
others.

## Plays well with git and friends

RPL was designed with the kind of syntax found in programming languages. In
particular, you can have whitespace and comments scattered around your (pattern)
code.  This makes RPL much easier to read and maintain than regex, but it also
makes diff-based tools like Git more useful.  Git, and tools like it, are based
on diff, which is line-oriented.  Most regex are embedded in programs as literal
strings dense with magic characters and escape sequences.  That makes it
difficult to see the changes when reading diff output:

<img
class="pure-img displayed"
src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/grok-diff-example.png" 
alt= "Output of diff comparing one grok file to another.  The definitions of
QUOTEDSTRING and IPV6, which are named patterns, differ between the two files.
But the syntax of the regex is so cryptic that it is very hard visually to find
the changes."
/>

Also, RPL patterns can be combined into packages.  A package can import other
packages, so that a group of interdependent files of RPL patterns can be stored
in an online repository (e.g. on [GitHub](github.com)).  That makes it easy to
use such a package:

* Do a `git clone` of the repo with the RPL package into a local directory
* Add the local directory to Rosie's `libpath`

## Plays well with Travis, Jenkins and friends

Rosie also plays well with build and test automation.  RPL files can contain
unit tests which are executed with the `rosie test` command.  The tests can be
run during development, to ensure (1) that changes to the pattern definitions
did not cause regression errors, and (2) to capture new requirements (where a
pattern must newly accept or reject certain input).

Finally, the compilation and unit test actions invoked by `rosie test` also
ensure that all pattern dependencies (packages) are available.

Today, Rosie does not support separate compilation and execution steps.  So it
is possible to pass unit tests but fail in deployment if the deployment
environment is missing a needed dependency.  (The same is true of Javascript,
Python, and other languages.)  However, the `rosie test` command can be used to
"smoke test" a deployment, to ensure that all RPL dependencies are installed,
that the RPL compiles without errors, and that the patterns pass all of their
unit tests.

## Discussion on reddit

A [Rosie subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/RosiePatternLanguage/) has been
created for discussion of these posts and for questions about Rosie and RPL.
See you there!
